# my-lightsout

This is the code for my extension of the Light Out puzzle! I added additional board sizes to the puzzle, beyond the original 5x5. I also added additional color settings beyond the original 2 colors. 
The goal was to investigate how the increases in board size and increases in color settings would affect the number of solvable boards generated.
The link to the full analysis is here: https://github.com/ericaflin/my-lightsout/blob/master/LightsOutPuzzling.pdf

The code of the original puzzle was borrowed from http://www.ueda.info.waseda.ac.jp/~n-kato/lightsout/index.html
